# DailyDrip

Coming Soon. Stay tuned...

User signs up/login → fills lifestyle questionnaire → responses sent to LLM → personalized daily schedule generated → user sees today's routine on dashboard → receives timely pings for each task → user marks tasks as done/skipped → earns XP, levels up, builds streak → user can customize routine or regenerate with LLM → app learns from user behavior and adapts future routines → optional features like weekly reports, mood tracking, challenges can be added later.

For me I have so many plans I have to complete by this year:
1. This AI app.
2. An AI Buzz creator.
3. An AI Trading application.
4. An AI Flashcard Anki App.
5. Have to learn so many things from computer science domain, especially, AI, ML, Quant Finance and Quantum Coumputing.
6. I have to also read so many books.
7. I also have to build an online presence now.
8. MMA.

And in order to maintain all that efficiently with respect to time management, I have to build this application first.
